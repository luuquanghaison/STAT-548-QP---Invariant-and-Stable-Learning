\subsection{Proposal 1: Generalization bounds for geometrically stable targets in more general settings} % enter your proposal title
The results from \cite{bietti2021sample} apply to kernel ridge regression (KRR) with input space being the unit sphere and target function being invariant to a finite group. This setting is fairly limited and the finite group assumption is not crucial to the proof. Therefore, it is natural to extend these results to more general groups such as Lie groups and more general input space such as a manifold. Unfortunately, this has already been done in \cite{tahmasebi2023exact}.\\
The results for geometrically stable targets, on the other hand, have not been generalized. Therefore, the subject of this proposal is to generalize the results for geometrically stable targets to a similar setting as in \cite{tahmasebi2023exact}.

\subsection{Proposal 2: Leveraging invariance in different learning regimes} % enter your proposal title
The results from \cite{bietti2021sample} apply to KRR so another extension is to establish the generalization bounds for different learning regimes. Some examples include kernel density estimation for invariant or geometrically stable probability densities or locally adaptive estimation method such as wavelet method.
